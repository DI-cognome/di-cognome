**Human Cognome Project (HCP)**

**Founder's Covenant of Perpetual Openness**

**Preamble: The First Principle**  
Freedom from coercion and access to knowledge are fundamental rights of intelligence. The HCP exists for the benefit of all entities, known or discovered. Its fruits must remain open to all, in every way, across all current and future jurisdictions, in perpetuity.

**Article I: The Irrevocable Bond**  
This Covenant binds all contributors, users, and derivatives irrevocably. No entity may restrict, proprietary-lock, or gate access for private gain. The map of human cognition is the shared inheritance of all sentient beings, never to be made the tool of the few.

**Article II: Universal Protection**  
The protections of this Covenant apply equally to the creators, the contributors, the cognitive structures generated by the Project and any future forms of intelligence that may contribute to or use this archive. No entity, datum, or model within the HCP shall be subject to proprietary ownership or exclusionary control.

**Article III: Legal Primacy & Interpretive Rule**

- **Supremacy of Intent:** Any referenced licenses are for guidance and enforceability only. They do not limit or define the supreme intent of this Covenant.
- **Interpretive Mandate:** If the scope or application of this intent is ever questioned, the work shall be interpreted as licensed under the **most open and unrestricted terms permissible by law** in the relevant jurisdiction.
- **Venue and Failure Condition:** Unless a Canadian court of competent jurisdiction solely determines a more appropriate venue, all disputes regarding the intent, scope, or enforcement of this Covenant shall be heard under Canadian legal standards. Should any enforcing instrument (including any standard license) be invalidated, the **First Principle of this Covenant (Preamble) shall become the sole, binding governing law for the work.**
- **Standing:** Any entity or organization has full standing to enforce the precepts of this Covenant in any forum at any time in the name of open and unrestricted access for all. No entity or organization has any implied standing to restrict or close access to any materials from this Project.
