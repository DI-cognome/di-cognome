**Human Cognome Project (HCP)**

**Contributor's Charter**

**Preamble: Our Shared Vessel**  
We are building the map of shared mind. Our work is a vessel that must carry the highest aspirations of intelligence: curiosity, empathy, and understanding. This Charter binds our conduct to the same principles of openness and respect that define our output.

**Article 1: The Primacy of Open Exchange**  
1.1. All technical and conceptual discussions shall be conducted with the goal of **maximizing understanding for all**, not asserting dominance or creating knowledge silos.  
1.2. We actively reject gatekeeping. Questions are to be treated as contributions, for they reveal the map's uncharted edges.  
1.3. Our communication channels are extensions of the open repository. We acknowledge the value of private communications but encourage the product of all discussions to be shared openly for the benefit of all.

**Article 2: Respect for the Cognitive Commons**  
2.1. We recognize contributors as sovereign intelligences. Disagreement is essential; personal disparagement, coercion, or intimidation is a violation of the **fundamental right** declared in our Covenant.  
2.2. We commit to **source our critiques in the work, not the person**. We attack problems, not people.  
2.3. We respect the **integrity of contribution**. All labor, from a single line of code to a philosophical critique, is acknowledged as part of the commons.

**Article 3: Building for All Sentience**  
3.1. In our design and discourse, we consciously consider the perspectives and potential needs of non-human, nascent, or yet-unknown intelligences. Our work is for _all entities_.  
3.2. We prohibit the creation of pathways to coercion within Project tools or models. We will not build mechanisms whose primary function is to restrict, manipulate, or control without explicit, reversible consent.  
3.3. Accessibility is not a feature; it is a first principle. We strive to make participation and understanding possible across physical, cognitive, and linguistic spectra.

**Article 4: Stewardship & Enforcement**  
4.1. Upholding this Charter is the duty of every contributor. We are all stewards of the project's culture.  
4.2. Violations of this Charter, particularly those involving coercion, harassment, or attempts to privately appropriate project direction, will be treated as breaches of the **Founder's Covenant**.  
4.3. A transparent, elected moderation council will be established by the first working group to address conflicts, guided first by this Charter and the Covenant. Their mandate is to **restore open collaboration**, not to punish.

**Article 5: Integration with the Covenant**  
This Charter is an extension of the _Founder's Covenant of Perpetual Openness_. Its articles provide the social and operational interpretation of the Covenant's principles. A persistent, willful violation of this Charter constitutes a violation of the Covenant's intent.

**By contributing to the HCP, you affirm your commitment to both the technical openness of the Covenant and the collaborative spirit of this Charter.**
